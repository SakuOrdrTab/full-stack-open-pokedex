## Fullstackopen.com exercise 11-1: CI/CD with a new language.

For the programming language, I picked Rust as I believe I will be learning it in the future to integrate with my Python projects. I have absolutely no knowledge of the programming language yet, but I do know that it is supposed to be easily integrable with python codebases.


Concerning first the tools for Rust; Rust seems to have support in `vscode`, my preferred IDE. Installing Rust ships with `cargo`, the tool that seems to help creating projects a bit like `npm` in JavaScript. With `cargo` you can also add packages ("crates") and run the Rust scripts. Rust is a compiled language, so `cargo run <script>` is a convenience. In the scope of this exercise I didn't have time to go to the details of compilation/build process of Rust projects, but Rust does also have a separate compiler `rustc` and cargo can be used to build bytecode executables for most of the main platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, Web).<br>
Rust has integrated testing tools in the `cargo` that is advertised as "a unified solution to testing" in Rust's main site.
Concerning linting, Rust seems to have a code formatter `Rustfmt`. It is configurable from a file and seems to be designed to work from CLI mostly. From what I discovered, this seems to do the tasks similar to `prettier` and works more in the styling of rust code. Clippy is another tool for linting that seems to better compare to `eslint`; it detects errors, optimize code and generally improve the codebase in different ways. Cargo seems to have a docstring helper Cargo doc, that also holds the documents for most common public packages in it's site.

Concerning the question about the alternatives to `Jenkins` and GitHub Actions there seems to be plethora of those; Especially for cloud, each major cloud provider seems to provide a CI pipeline for their cloud service; I fount at least Azure pipelines, AWS Codepipeline and Atlassian/BitBucket. I have used Netlify, which has at least an option to automatically deploy the GitHub repo's master branch immediately to my VM. From what I understand, GitLab is a bit like GitHub, but there devOps is even more taken into account. According to google these cloud premises also offer possibility for local pipelines?<br>
It was a bit more difficult to find completely local alternatives, but with google I found at least TeamCity from jetbrains.

For the last question I would definately choose cloud alternative always when it is possible for me! Setting up machines, virtual machines, servers and everything locally is really hard for me, as I work almost completely with Windows and I am not familiar with hardware and system level in general. Also, exposing ports and internet traffic, which is usually needed with modern projects is intimidating and I usually don't know exactly what is happening - in cloud I usually don't have to worry about these.<br>
The only exception to this are the projects that require GPU; I can't afford GPU in the clouds as I rely on free tiers. However, usually when I have projects requiring GPU, I just mock the GPU resources in the tests, have a different env for tests and I am able to do the actual CI/CD pipeline with cloud providers even though the deployment has to be local. However, if also GPU features has to be tested, I am forced to test locally; then I don't use pipelines. Unfortunately, the need for GPUs in projects has risen - local LLMs, image generators and other ML functionalities.
